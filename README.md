# Stock-Market-Management
This is a CLI operated DBMS for Stock Market , built using Python and MySQL with CRUD language.
The project revolves around creating a CLI in which a user can analyse stocks using data and graph-based analysis.
The user can also keep a track of favorite stocks.
A security based authentication mechanism has been supported which uses email-id as username(because it is unique) and a password.
Everyone has to create a user-id before they can access the database through querying.
